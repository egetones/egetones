**Who am I?**
Just a tech enthusiast diving deep into the world of **Cybersecurity**, **OSINT**, and **OpSec**. I like keeping my digital footprint small and my systems secure. Currently exploring the depths of the Linux ecosystem with Fedora.

**What I'm up to**
**Linux:** Daily driving **Fedora Workstation**. Focused on system hardening and living in the terminal.
**OSINT:** Digging into open-source intelligence and data analysis techniques.
**OpSec:** Prioritizing privacy, anonymity, and security best practices.
**Scripting:** Automating the boring stuff with Bash and shell scripting.
