🕵️‍♂️ **Who am I?**
Just a tech enthusiast diving deep into the world of **Cybersecurity**, **OSINT**, and **OpSec**. I like keeping my digital footprint small and my systems secure. Currently exploring the depths of the Linux ecosystem with Fedora.

🎯 **What I'm up to**
* 🐧 **Linux:** Daily driving **Fedora Workstation**. Focused on system hardening and living in the terminal.
* 👁️ **OSINT:** Digging into open-source intelligence and data analysis techniques.
* 🛡️ **OpSec:** Prioritizing privacy, anonymity, and security best practices.
* 💻 **Coding:** Building security tools and scripting to automate the boring stuff.
